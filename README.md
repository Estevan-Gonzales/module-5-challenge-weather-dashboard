# Module 6 Challenge - Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application is my solution to the Module 6 Challenge of the Coding Bootcamp.
This application allows users to view the current weather and 5-day forecast for cities that they select. Each city is saved to a list, and can be selected by the mouse click after added.
Through this project, I learned how to retrieve information from a server-side API, and display it in an easy to understand format.

## Installation

### Option 1:
1. Inspect written JavaScript code directly on Github.
2. View Github page of raw JavaScript code using the link below:
   https://github.com/Estevan-Gonzales/module-6-challenge-weather-dashboard/blob/main/assets/js/script.js
3. Use Developer Tools to view meta data associated with the compiled JavaScript found below:
   https://estevan-gonzales.github.io/module-6-challenge-weather-dashboard/.
 
### Option 2:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open in VS Code.
3. Inspect written code and HTML page with Live Server.

## Usage
1. Navigate to deployed site. You should be presented with the weather conditions for a default city (in this case Austin, TX).
